### <ins>Appendix A: The Shell</ins>

Shell (pseudo-synonyms: terminal, command line, console)
  - a program on your computer whose job it is to run other programs.

Bash
  - most common shell, sometimes used as a proxy

HappyGit shells are used for tasks like
  - navigating the file system
  - doing Git operations that we don't want or can't use RStudio for
Can be less ambiguous and perishable than graphical user interfaces (GUIs)

Starting a Shell from RStudio
  Tools > *Terminal* launches in RStudio (most typical/"useful")
  Tools > *Shell* launches in an external window
